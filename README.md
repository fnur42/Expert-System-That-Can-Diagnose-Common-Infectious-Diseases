Yaygın Bulaşıcı Hastalıkları Teşhis Edebilen Uzman Sistem
I made a presentation within the course of Expert System Design that Can Diagnose Common Infectious Diseases. During the presentation, I showed examples of diagnosing the diseases I defined in the database by running the expert system that I developed with the Prolog language during the presentation. Recommendations for the treatment of the disease are also made in the extension system based on the detection of the disease by questioning the symptoms of the disease.
